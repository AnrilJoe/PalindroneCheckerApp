# PalindroneCheckerApp
PalindroneCheckerApp
Objective
The goal of this project is to implement basic palindrome validation logic using fundamental Java programming concepts before moving on to advanced data structures.

Flow of Project
The application follows a linear execution flow:

Initialize: Define a hardcoded string value.

Process: Execute a comparison loop to check characters from both ends of the string.

Validate: Determine if the string reads the same forward and backward.

Output: Display the final result (Palindrome or Not) to the console.

Topics Covered
String manipulation and character indexing.

Control flow using for loops.

Boolean logic for validation.

Console output using System.out.println.

Use Case 2: Hardcoded Palindrome Validation
This specific use case focuses on "Hardcoded Palindrome Validation". It is designed to test the core logic of the application without the complexity of dynamic user input.

Working of Use Case 2
The core logic utilizes an optimized loop that only iterates through half of the string length.

It compares the character at index i with the character at the corresponding mirror position from the end.

If a mismatch is found at any point, the validation fails immediately, making the algorithm efficient.
